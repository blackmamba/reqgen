This node js based application can be used to test a sitespeed enabled application in QA environment. Developers usually would like to test an application in QA environment before releasing an application, to the production. This application enables testing a page by reloading it n number of times. Just provide the url that requres to be tested, and also the number of time the page should be reloaded. This application combined with Sitespeed in QA (https://wiki.vip.corp.ebay.com/display/RAPTOR/Sitespeed+in+QA+environment), enabled not just generating sitespeed numbers, but also allows developers to visualize the results through the sitespeed dashboard for qa.
